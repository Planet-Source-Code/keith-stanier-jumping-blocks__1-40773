Jumper.

Jumper is a puzzle that looks easy but its here to deceive you.
It involves eight boxes that have to be manipulated in a certain
way and moved to a certain area. You might think you are making
the right move, but you are really putting yourself in a jam you
can't reverse.

If you have any comments or find any bugs then please let me know.
