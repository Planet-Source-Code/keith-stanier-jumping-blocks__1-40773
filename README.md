### Description

Jumper is a puzzle that looks easy but its here to deceive you. It involves eight boxes that have to be manipulated in a certain way and moved to a certain position. Because I've had comments about the help not working. This game was made years ago so I use the old Win3.1 help. I've updated the help and it should work on any Windows version 9x/NT/ME/2000/XP. Full credit to Firas Bushnaq for the idea behind this game.
